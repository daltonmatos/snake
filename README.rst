Snake
-----

Do you remeber? =) This is the classic snake game, written entirely in assembly language.

This is a toy-project I made back in 2004 when I was on the second year
of college I was a teacher assistant in assembly language.

Believe or not, this was done in *one* weekend. I remember that it was not that difficult to write, but honestly I will remember *zero things*  if I read the code today.

I'm publishung it more as a backup than to be really useful to someone.


Tech notes
----------

It was written in pure assembly, not for any specific operation system. If I remember correctly I just assembled the code using ``nasm`` and then ``cat <code> > /dev/fd0`` so I was able to boot directly from the floppy drive, yes a *floppy drive!* =)

If you like low level programmim, Enjoy!!
